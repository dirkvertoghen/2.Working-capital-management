1. Based on the given extract from the annual financials of a production company (in US$) for the past year calculate the length of the working capital cycle (assuming 365 days in the year).
Inventories

                Raw materials   108 000
                Work in progress   76 500
                Finished goods   86 400
                Purchases of raw materials   518 400
                Cost of production   675 000
                Cost of goods sold   756 000
                Sales   864 000
                Receivables   172 800
                Payables   86 400

                solution.
                Raw materials =  108 000 / 518 400       = 76,041667
                WIP = 76 500 / 675 000 * 365             = 41,36667
                Finished goods = 864 000 / 756 000 * 365 = 41,714286
                Receivables = 172 800 / 86 400           = 73
                Payables = 86 400 / 518400 * 365         = 60,8333
                
                working capital cycles = 76,041667 + 41,36667 + 41,714286 + 73 + 60,8333 = 171,28929



2. Company’s managers estimate that there is demand for 50,000 units of material p.a. The purchase price of each unit is $20. The ordering costs for this material is $20 for each order placed. Inventory holding costs amount to 10% p.a. of inventory value.

                  2) Calculatethetotalinventorycostsforthisorderquantity,

orders from 5,000 to 10,000 the discount is 1 %, for the orders exceeding 10,000 the discount is 1.5 %. What would now be the Economic Order Quantity?


4. Co A’s annual revenues are estimated at $10 mln and its customers are currently provided with a three-months’ credit. The management is considering offering a discount of 4% for payment within one month. The company is paying overdraft interest of 20% p.a.
Required:

                      1) Calculate the effective annual % cost of the discount
                      2) Suggest on the discount.

6.  A company’s annual sales are $15 mln and its customers currently take credit as
follows:
The Company is considering offering a discount of 1% for payment within 10 days. It is estimated that 80% of customers will take advantage of the discount (and that the remainder will take a full 45 days). The company’s bank overdraft rate is 16% p.a.

8. Company A generates sales of $12 mln per year and its customers pay as follows:
Management is deciding whether it should factor the debts. The factor is supposed to pay 100% of debts after 1 month for the fee of 2% of the turnover. The policy will allow to save annual personnel costs of $15k. The Company A’s bank overdraft rate is 20% p.a.
Required: Calculate the net cost or benefit p.a. of changing to the new policy (assume 360 days in a year).

                                        Days   % of sales
                                        30      20%

                                        90      50%


9. Company’s suppliers offer a 2% discount if bills are paid no later than in 10 days after receipt. Currently the company pays invoices in 30 days and therefore there is no discount provided.
Required: assuming that there are 360 days in a year and bank overdraft is available at a rate of 20%, advise whether or not the Company should pay within 10 days.


10. A company currently takes 40 days credit from suppliers on the basis that this is ‘free’ finance. Annual purchases are $100,000 and the company pays overdraft interest of 13%. Payment within 15 days would attract a 1.5% quick settlement discount.
Required: assess whether a company should take advantage of the discount? (assume 365 days in a year)


11. Sportwaren GmbH is a company specializing in resale of sport equipment and health nutrition. One of the goods offered to customers is a protein shake drink called “Muskel Max”. Management has estimated that weekly sales of the drink would be 300 bottles and the annual storage cost for a bottle would be as high as EUR 4. Delivery from Sportwaren’s existing supplier takes 2 weeks and the purchase price per item is EUR 18. The current supplier charges EUR 65 order processing fee for each order, regardless of its size. Sportwaren has recently been approached by another supplier of Muskel Max with the following offer: the price per bottle is fixed at EUR 17 each. There will be a fixed order processing charge of EUR 315 regardless of order size. Delivery time will be one week. The estimated annual storage cost per bottle due to packaging differences will be EUR 3.70.
Required:

      - Assuming Sportwaren continues to purchase from the existing supplier, calculate: (a) Economic order quantity; (b) Reorder     level; (c) Total cost of stocking Muskel Max per annum to the nearest EUR, i.e. the purchase, ordering and holding costs.
      -  Calculate the economic order quantity if Sportwaren GmbH changes to the new supplier and determine if it would be financially viable to replace the existing supplier.
      -  Discuss TWO limitations of the calculations performed in (1) and (2) and describe THREE other non- financial factors to be considered before a final decision is made.
