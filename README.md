1. Based on the given extract from the annual financials of a production company (in US$) for the past year calculate the length of the working capital cycle (assuming 365 days in the year).
Inventories

                Raw materials   108 000
                Work in progress   76 500
                Finished goods   86 400
                Purchases of raw materials   518 400
                Cost of production   675 000
                Cost of goods sold   756 000
                Sales   864 000
                Receivables   172 800
                Payables   86 400

                solution.
                Raw materials =  108 000 / 518 400       = 76,041667
                WIP = 76 500 / 675 000 * 365             = 41,36667
                Finished goods = 864 000 / 756 000 * 365 = 41,714286
                Receivables = 172 800 / 86 400           = 73
                Payables = 86 400 / 518400 * 365         = 60,8333
                
                working capital cycles = 76,041667 + 41,36667 + 41,714286 + 73 + 60,8333 = 171,28929



2. Company’s managers estimate that there is demand for **50,000** units of material p.a. The purchase price of each unit is **$20**. The ordering costs for this material is **$20** for each order placed. Inventory holding costs amount to **10%** p.a. of inventory value.
Required:

                  1) Calculate the Economic Order Quantity,
                  2) Calculate the total inventory costs for this order quantity,
                  3) Suppose that the supplier offers discounts on purchase price as follows:forthe
   
orders from **5,000** to **10,000** the discount is **1 %**, for the orders exceeding **10,000** the discount is **1.5 %**. What would now be the Economic Order Quantity?

      Economic oder quantity                                  (2 * 50000 * 20/2,00)^(1/2)=1000      5 0000                      10 0000

      purchasing(demand*price)                                    50 000 * 20 = 1.000.000          50000 * 19,8 = 990 000       50 000 * 19,7 = 985 000
      Ordering costs(dmnd/eco.quant*ordercost)                    50 000/1000 * 20 = 1000          50000/5000*20 = 200          50000/10000*20 = 100       
      Holding cost(econ.order/2*holding cost)                     1000/2*2 = 1000                   5000/2*1,98 = 4950          10000/2*1,97 = 9850
      Total(inventcost + purchasing + order cost+hldingcost)      (1000.000+1000+1000)=1002.0000       995.150                       994.950
      so the total inventory costs for this order quantity 994.950

4. Co A’s annual revenues are estimated at **$10 mln** and its customers are currently provided with a three-months’ credit. The management is considering offering a discount of **4%** for payment within one month. The company is paying overdraft interest of **20%** p.a.
Required:

                      1) Calculate the effective annual % cost of the discount
                      2) Suggest on the discount.

              2months %             = 4/96                  = 4,17%
              1 year % equivalent   = ( 1 + 4,17%)^(12/2-1) = 27,75
   
5.  A company’s annual sales are **$15 mln** and its customers currently take credit as
follows:
The Company is considering offering a discount of **1%** for payment within **10 days**. It is estimated that **80%** of customers will take advantage of the discount (and that the remainder will take a full **45 days**). The company’s bank overdraft rate is **16%** p.a.

                    solution : 

                                          Days  % of sales          Annual sales = 15 000 000

                                          45     30%
                    
                    Current AR ( account receivable ) = (15*20%) + ( 30 * 50%) +(45*30%) = 31,5
                    Average AR level (currentAR/365 * annual sales )                            31,5/365 * 15 000 000   = 1.294.521
                    Proposed AR turnover (payment 10 days*estimated80%+time45days*%sales)       10 * 80% + 45 * 20%     = 17
                    Proposed average AR level  (proposed ar turnover/365*newsales )             17/365*14.880000        = 693.041 
                    Interest saved ( average AR level-proposed average ar level)*interest saved 1.294.521 - 693.041*16% = 96236,71

                    Net cost of discount = 120 000 - 96236,71 = 23.763
                    Therefore we do not accept 

6. Company A generates **sales of $12 mln** per year and its customers pay as follows:
Management is deciding whether it should factor the debts. The factor is supposed to pay **100%*** of debts after **1 month** for the fee of **2%** of the turnover. The policy will allow to save annual personnel costs of **$15k**. The Company A’s bank overdraft rate is **20%** p.a.
Required: Calculate the net cost or benefit p.a. of changing to the new policy (assume **360 days** in a year).

        Current AR level (Current AR turnover / 365 days * sale   69 / 360* 12 000 000 = 2.300 000
        Proposed AR turnover(Current AR turnover/365 days * sale )  69/360* 12 000 000 = 30 
        Proposed AR "account receivable"  level (Proposed AR turnover / 360 * 12 000 000 = 1 000 000
        Saved intereset = ( Current AR level - Proposed AR level )* intereset rate20% )  (2.300 000 - 1.000 000 )* 20 = 260 000
        
        Factor fee  P.A * sale = 2% * 12 000 000 = 240 000
        Benefit( staff costs ) = 15 000
        
        Net benefit  saved interest + Benefit - Factor fee = 260 000 + 15 000 - 240 000 = 35 000 

**To accept the proposal**

8. Company’s suppliers offer a 2% discount if bills are paid no later than in 10 days after receipt. Currently the company pays invoices in 30 days and therefore there is no discount provided.
Required: assuming that there are 360 days in a year and bank overdraft is available at a rate of 20%, advise whether or not the Company should pay within 10 days.


9. A company currently takes 40 days credit from suppliers on the basis that this is ‘free’ finance. Annual purchases are $100,000 and the company pays overdraft interest of 13%. Payment within 15 days would attract a 1.5% quick settlement discount.
Required: assess whether a company should take advantage of the discount? (assume 365 days in a year)


11. Sportwaren GmbH is a company specializing in resale of sport equipment and health nutrition. One of the goods offered to customers is a protein shake drink called “Muskel Max”. Management has estimated that weekly sales of the drink would be 300 bottles and the annual storage cost for a bottle would be as high as EUR 4. Delivery from Sportwaren’s existing supplier takes 2 weeks and the purchase price per item is EUR 18. The current supplier charges EUR 65 order processing fee for each order, regardless of its size. Sportwaren has recently been approached by another supplier of Muskel Max with the following offer: the price per bottle is fixed at EUR 17 each. There will be a fixed order processing charge of EUR 315 regardless of order size. Delivery time will be one week. The estimated annual storage cost per bottle due to packaging differences will be EUR 3.70.
Required:

      - Assuming Sportwaren continues to purchase from the existing supplier, calculate: (a) Economic order quantity; (b) Reorder     level; (c) Total cost of stocking Muskel Max per annum to the nearest EUR, i.e. the purchase, ordering and holding costs.
      -  Calculate the economic order quantity if Sportwaren GmbH changes to the new supplier and determine if it would be financially viable to replace the existing supplier.
      -  Discuss TWO limitations of the calculations performed in (1) and (2) and describe THREE other non- financial factors to be considered before a final decision is made.
